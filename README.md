# 100-python-projects

Recently I went through this course "Master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days".
As a python developer, it felt intriging for me to checkout this course content. When I checked
It was a vast content and covered most of the domains from beginner level to master. So I thought 
why not give a try and takeup a 100 days challenge before the starting new year 2024.

I don't know if I will complete this challenge for 100 days, but if I do, I will feel good, Let's see..
